Possible values are:\n* BLOOD_SMEAR_PARASITES - A sample of blood is viewed under a microscope and the number of parasites per microliter of blood is counted. This diagnostic includes some randomness because real-world smear tests may not perfectly measure parasite levels in a person's system. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of parasites per microliter of blood. This setting uses the **Measurement_Sensitivity** parameter and if **measurement** is larger than **Detection_Threshold** in the following equation, a positive diagnosis is made:\n    ``measurement = ( 1 / Measurement_Sensitivity ) * Poisson (x)`` where ``x = Measurement_Sensitivity * true_parasite_density``\n* BLOOD_SMEAR_GAMETOCYTES - A sample of blood is viewed under a microscope and the number of gametocytes per microliter of blood is counted. This diagnostic includes some randomness because real-world smear tests may not perfectly measure gametocyte levels in a person's system. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of gametocytes per microliter of blood. This setting uses the **Measurement_Sensitivity** parameter and if **measurement** is larger than **Detection_Threshold** in the following equation, a positive diagnosis is made:\n    ``measurement = ( 1 / Measurement_Sensitivity ) * Poisson (x)`` where ``x = Measurement_Sensitivity * true_gametocyte_density``\n* FEVER - The fever detection threshold is defined as the number of degrees Celsius above a normal body temperature of 37 degrees. If a person's body temperature is above this threshold, a positive diagnosis is made. For example, a **Detection_Threshold** of 2 would result in a positive diagnosis for temperatures above 39 degrees. Fever as a diagnostic uses a model of cytokines based on the paper `Innate immunity to malaria <https://doi.org/10.1038/nri1311>`_.\n* PCR_PARASITES - The intervention models a quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) type measurement of parasite density and draws a value from a random Gaussian distribution. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of parasites per microliter of blood. This measurement is based on the paper `Improving statistical inference on pathogen densities estimated by quantitative molecular methods: malaria gametocytaemia as a case study <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0402-2>`_.\n* PCR_GAMETOCYTES - The intervention models a quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) type measurement of gametocyte density and draws a value from a random Gaussian distribution. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of gametocytes per microliter of blood. This measurement is based on the paper `Improving statistical inference on pathogen densities estimated by quantitative molecular methods: malaria gametocytaemia as a case study <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0402-2>`_.\n* PF_HRP2 - Measures the number of picograms of histidine-rick protein 2 (HRP2) in a microliter of blood. **Detection_Threshold** is in picograms of HRP2 per microliter of blood. This is modeled with boost and decay parameters and is based on the paper `Modelling the dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in human malaria to better understand malaria rapid diagnostic test performance <https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-11-74>`_.\n* TRUE_PARASITE_DENSITY - A true measure of the number of parasites per microliter of blood. **Detection_Threshold** is in parasites per microliter of blood.",
